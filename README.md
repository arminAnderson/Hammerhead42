# Hammerhead42
42 key board with 24 degree angled sides with 3key support

# Current required hardware
* M2 screws
* M2 threaded inserts (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D477R64K?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)
* RKJXT1F42001 (https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/alps-alpine/RKJXT1F42001/19529127, cap here: https://www.printables.com/model/1013994-rkjxt1f42001-cap)
* 40mm cirque touchpad (https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Cirque/TM040040-2024-302?qs=wd5RIQLrsJgMzmw571gvDw%3D%3D)
* 4 wires (touchpad is handwired to a breakout)
* Helios or similar (https://keeb.supply/products/0xcb-helios)
* Rubber feet
* One set of 2u stabs for right hand side (optional)

# v0.9 (current)
* Now using PCB instead of handwire

# Fixes planned for 1.0
* Right now, the case uses printed washers to help pin the case to the pcb, and rubber feet on the bottom to keep the pcb off the desk. Originally I did this to keep the thickness as minimal as possible, but I'd like to design a 2 piece case with a bottom
* Some of the mounting holes for the case on the pcb are tenths of a mm off, which probably isn't even perceptible but I want to get those perfectly aligned 
* Cases without the RKJXT1F and/or trackpad
* A way to mount the trackpad without a full case
* Full build guide
* Multiple key configurations (all 1u, for example). Currently, the non-1u keys are
  * 1.25 tab
  * 1.5 \|
  * 1.5 enter
  * 1.75 shift (left thumb)
  * 2 space (right thumb)
